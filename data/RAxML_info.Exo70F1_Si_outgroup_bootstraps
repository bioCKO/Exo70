RAxML Bipartition Computation: Drawing support values from trees in file allBootstraps onto tree in file RAxML_result.Exo70F1_Si_outgroup


RAxML was called as follows:

raxml -f b -z allBootstraps -t RAxML_result.Exo70F1_Si_outgroup -m GTRGAMMA -o SiExo70F1 -n Exo70F1_SI_outgroup_bootstraps 




Found 1 tree in File RAxML_result.Exo70F1_Si_outgroup



Found 200 trees in File allBootstraps



Found 1 tree in File RAxML_result.Exo70F1_Si_outgroup
