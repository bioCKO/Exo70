Analysis of Exo70 gene family and NLR-Exo70

We describe the annotation of the Exo70 gene family from barley and integrate the identified genes within existing resources from <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, <i>Oryza sativa</i>, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Using resequencing data from a diverse panel of accessions in <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> and <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, we assess nucleotide diversity and presence/absence variation. Next, we assess tissue-dependent gene expression in <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> for the Exo70 gene families and associate with existing knowledge in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Lastly, we analyze the integration of Exo70 into nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins.

## Analysis of Exo70 integrations within NLRs
An analysis that can occur would look across all plant species for the integration of Exo70 into NLRs. Questions include (1) are there intregrations in other species?, (2) do they all have the same orientation?, and (3) are all Exo70 derived from the same group? (we already know the answer is no, Exo70F and Exo70FX).

## BLAST analysis of RGH2-Exo70 (Baronesse) on <i>Aegilops sharonensis</i>
BLAST of RGH2-Exo70 (Baronesse) on <i>Aegilops sharonensis</i> accession 1644 found that the RGH2 homolog mapped to a different genomic contig (contig_545984) compared to the TRX domain (contig_71920).
