# Exo70
Analysis of Exo70 gene family and NLR-Exo70

We describe the annotation of the Exo70 gene family from barley and integrate the identified genes within existing resources from <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, <i>Oryza sativa</i>, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Using resequencing data from a diverse panel of accessions in <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> and <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i>, we assess nucleotide diversity and presence/absence variation. Last, we assess tissue-dependent gene expression in <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> for the Exo70 gene families and associate with existing knowledge in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.
